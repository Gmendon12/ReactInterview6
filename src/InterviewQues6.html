        <strong>  Events in ReactJs</strong>

        <p>
            An Event is an action that can be triggered as a result of user action or a system generated event eg. a mouse click, mouse hover, loading of a webpage, pressing a key etc.
            Event Handlers are responsible to make our app more user interactive. React consists of its own react handling systems  <br> <br>

            
            <ul>
                *Difference between event handlers in JS and ReactJs <br>
                <li>
                    In React, we use the camelCase to name the events instead of lowercase
                    e.g "button onClick={displayText()}"
                </li>
                <li>
                    in React, we pass a function as an event and not a string, like in JS
                </li>
            </ul>

         <strong>Memory Leak and how to overcome it</strong> 

        <p>
            Every React Component has a lifecycle and the three main phases are : Mounting , Updating and Unmounting.
            In mounting phase, the component is created and inserted into the DOM. In the unmounting phase, the component is removed and destroeyd from the DOM. 
             <br/> <br> Any subscriptions, timers, API calls that were created in the mounting phase, should be cancelled before the unmounting phase.
            If we fail to do so , that subscription will be stored in the memory of the component and now we will have unimportant data in our app which is not accessible.
             <br> <br> If this process is repreated multiple times, usefull memory will be filled up with inaccessible data leading to performance issues or crashing the system.

             <ul>
           <strong> How to overcome memory leaks</strong>
                <li>
                    in Function components , we can use the useEffect clean up function , which helps us clean up subscriptions and asynchronous tasks before the component unmounts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In Class components, we can directly use the lifecycle method ie. ComponentWillUnmount to cancel any subscriptions
                </li>
                <li>
                    if we are fetching API calls, we can use AbortControllers. AbortController represents a controller object that will allow you to abort one or more web requests.
                    for eg. we can cancel the API request when navigating to a new page
                </li>
             </ul>
        </p>
    </li>

        <strong>Should you use Class or Functional Compoent ?</strong>

        <p>
            The actual answer to this is - personal choice. It is the choice of the developer which component is better as both of them have pros and cons.
            But ideally the fucntional component is easier to understadn, more concise, leading to cleaner, less complex code.

                    Component Rendering - In class components, the render() method is used for rendering the JSX by extending React.Component. A functional component is plain JS function that returns a JSX. It is more simple to use as we do not need the render() function

                <li>
                    Hnadling Props - in Class Components, this.props is used to access our name props. in Functional component we take props as arguments and acess them directly in the return statement.
                    in Functional Component we do not have to worry about the "this" keyword
